## BFS TEMPLATE
```python
    

```


Level-order traversal (top-down, bottom-up, zig-zag), including for n-ary tree  
For each level, return the average of all values, the max/min  
Left or Right side view (for each level, return the leftmost/rightmost value)  
Min or max depth (for each level, check if you find a leaf node)  
Max level sum (for each level, maintain level sum, and pick max)  
Add a new row (level)  
Populate sibling pointers (pointer to next node in level order)  
Is tree univalued? Are two nodes cousins? (parents should be in same level)  
Is a tree complete? (All levels except last filled...)  
Maximum width of a tree (width defined for each level)  
Are two trees the same? (Their level-orders tours should look the same)  
Clone a tree (Tour the tree and construct the second in level-order along the tour)  
Is a tree symmetric? (Level-order tour from both endpoints should be mirror images)
