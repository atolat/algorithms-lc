### Yelp/Proximity Server
Proximity servers are used to discover nearby attractions like places, events, etc. If you havenâ€™t used yelp.com before, please try it before proceeding (you can search for nearby restaurants, theaters, etc.) and spend some time understanding different options that the website offers.

#### Functional Requirements
- Users should be able to add/delete/update Places.
- Given their location (longitude/latitude), users should be able to find all nearby places within a given radius.
- Users should be able to add feedback/review about a place. The feedback can have pictures, text, and a rating.

#### Non Functional Requirements
- Users should have a real-time search experience with minimum latency.
- Our service should support a heavy search load. There will be a lot of search requests compared to adding a new place.

**Capacity Estimation**
- Main Table - Location Entry
  - ID UUID 32 bytes
  - Name str 256 bytes
  - Category 1 byte
  - GPS(latitude + longitude) 16 bytes
  - Description 1 kB
- ~ 1 MB for each location entry * (Total Entries) * Replication Factor + Year on increase
- 100k concurrent users 

- Choice of DB:
  - Our system needs to support high QPS
  - Consistency is not top priority
    - If a location's information changes, delays in updates are tolerable.
  - Choose NoSQL for location data, RDBMS for user profiles - MongoDB or Elastic Search
  - We need our DB to provide search support
    - full text 
    - GIS

**High Level Design**
![Design](https://i.imgur.com/rnTX2Qa.png)
- Read heavy system
- CDN is essential
- Photos uploaded by users can go through system's API gateway and then to S3 or directly to S3 using S3s SDK
- Memcached for caching user profiles and ratings
- Order management - STEP functions - BPMN(Business Process Management) - Business strategies represented as pictorial diagrams where each sequential step maps to an API.
- Anomaly detection - Logs -> Logstash -> Elasticsearch alerts.

**Location Based Search**
- Searching based on search space reduction on geospacial indices
- Use quad trees to store location information
- Partition Quad trees for availability and replication.
